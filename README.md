# capstone-I

## Project Overview

The landing page of this site displays a piece of art from the Art Institute of Chicago and asks the user to select who created the artwork. When the user selects correctly, information is displayed about that art piece.
If youâ€™re one of those people who always wanted to know who made a work of art just by looking at it, this application will help you achieve 
that goal! You can learn who made a work of art, flashcard style, so that you can begin to recognize similarities in their style, medium usage,
and the styles of that period.
